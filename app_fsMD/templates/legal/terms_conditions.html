                <p>
                  FullScopeMD provides telehealth services delivered by licensed U.S. clinicians where medically appropriate. Services
                  may include clinical evaluations, follow-up care, prescription management, and pharmacy coordination.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Services do not provide emergency or urgent medical care. Telehealth is not a replacement for in-person evaluation
                  when required.
