                <p class="mb-2">
                  “Telehealth” (or “telemedicine”) includes the delivery of healthcare services using electronic communications and technologies instead of in-person visits.
                  Telehealth may involve:
                </p>
                <ul class="mb-0 d-grid gap-2">
                  <li class="text-body-sm">Live audio and/or video communication</li>

                <p class="mb-2">
                  Telehealth services are provided by independently licensed healthcare professionals (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or other qualified clinicians).
